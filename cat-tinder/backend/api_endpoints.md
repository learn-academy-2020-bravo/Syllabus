# Cat Tinder API Endpoints


## Update Application Controller
We need to update the application controller to allow requests from applications other than this Rails app (the React app runs all on its own).  To do this, we add this line to the ApplicationController:

```ruby
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
    skip_before_action :verify_authenticity_token # <- Add this line
end

```
```ruby
class CatsController < ApplicationController
end
```
Our app needs two routes to start, an 'index' listing all the cats, and a 'create' route so that users can submit new cat information to the application.

## Routes for Cats

| URL | Method | Controller Method |
| /cats | get | index |
| /cats | post | create |

We can stub these methods into the controller now:

```ruby
class CatsController < ApplicationController
  def index
  end

  def create
  end
end
```

### Convention over Configuration
The name of these routes is important.  Rails knows to route the requests in the table above to the proper methods in our controller.  As long as we name the methods exactly as above, Rails will know what to do, and everything will work great.  If we were to ignore these conventions, our job would get very hard, very quickly, so let's stick with the 'Rails Way' of doing things, and make it easy on ourselves.


## Index route
We start with the index route.  In this endpoint, we want to return all of the cats that the application knows about.  Later on, we may want to add search and/or pagination, but for now we'll keep things simple and just return all the cats.

### Create a spec
We're going to practice Test Driven Development, so let's start with a test.  We'll add a `requests` folder to the `spec` folder that RSPEC generated. Then, we'll add our test file:

**/spec/requests/cats_request_spec.rb**

```ruby
require 'rails_helper'

describe "Cats API", type: :request do
  it "gets a list of Cats" do
    # Create a new cat in the Test Database (not the same one as development)
    Cat.create(name: 'Felix', age: 2, enjoys: 'Walks in the park')

    # Make a request to the API
    get '/cats'

    # Convert the response into a Ruby Hash
    json = JSON.parse(response.body)

    # Assure that we got a successful response
    expect(response).to have_http_status(:ok)

    # Assure that we got one result back as expected
    expect(json.length).to eq 1
  end
end
```

When we run that spec, it fails of course, because we don't have any code in the controller to respond to the request correctly. Yay failure!


Now we can write the controller code to make it pass:

```ruby
def index
  cats = Cat.all
  render json: cats
end
```

### Try it in the browser
If you followed the setup in the last module, then you should already have a cat in your database to return.  You can add as many as you like using the Rails console ```$ rails c``` on the command line.  Start up the application, and navigate a browser to our new endpoint, we should see output similar to this:

## Create
Next we'll tackle the 'create' route.  Let's start with adding a new test to **/spec/requests/cats_request_spec.rb**:

```ruby
  it "creates a cat" do
    # The params we are going to send with the request
    cat_params = {
      cat: {
        name: 'Buster',
        age: 4,
        enjoys: 'Meow Mix, and plenty of sunshine.'
      }
    }

    # Send the request to the server
    post '/cats', params: cat_params

    # Assure that we get a success back
    expect(response).to have_http_status(:ok)

    # Look up the cat we expect to be created in the Database
    new_cat = Cat.first

    # Assure that the created cat has the correct attributes
    expect(new_cat.name).to eq('Buster')
  end
```

And once again, this fails because we have no code in the controller to make it pass.  Good!  Adding the controller code for this spec is as follows:

```ruby
  def create
    # Create a new cat
    cat = Cat.create(cat_params)

    # respond with our new cat
    render json: cat
  end

  # Handle strong parameters, so we are secure
  def cat_params
    params.require(:cat).permit(:name, :age, :enjoys)
  end
```

And we're Green!  This isn't quite production ready code, but its enough to get our first test of the endpoint to pass, which is what we're after, so we're happy.  

## Summary
In this section, we've built out our first API endpoint to handle requests for listing and creating cats.  In the next section, we're going to deal with validating that the information passed to the ```create``` route is what we expect and handle situations when it's not.

## Challenges
- Add an Index endpoint to your application
- Add an Create endpoint to your application
